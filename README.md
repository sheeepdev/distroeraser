This script erases your drive to get it ready for a new OS/distro!

I made this script for my ThinkPad which I distrohop on often.

Requirements: \
[`figlet`](https://repology.org/project/figlet/versions) \
[`dd`](https://repology.org/project/coreutils/versions) \
[`bash`](https://repology.org/project/bash/versions)

> **Note** \
> `/dev/sda` is the default disk specified in the script and you will probably need to change it! I'm gonna introduce automatically choosing a disk later

> **Warning** \
> I am not responsible for any system erasing. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This script erases your drive to get it ready for a new OS/distro!

I made this script for my ThinkPad which I distrohop on often.

Requirements: \
[`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation) \
[`dd`](https://repology.org/project/coreutils/versions) \
[`bash`](https://repology.org/project/bash/versions)

> **Warning** \
> I am not responsible for any system erasing. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
